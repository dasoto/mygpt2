# Minimal GPT2 (124M)

This repo is based on the [Andrej Karpathy's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8pRSuU81PU) and the paper [Language models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners](https://cdn.openai.com/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf).

This repo will try to reproduce the code with my own additions and interpretations in the following frameworks:

- Pytorch
- JAX
